Welcome to the C20 MillionLights GitHub repository! This repository contains the source code and documentation for our exciting project that brought together over 1500 participants in a dynamic and interactive real-time event. With the power of web development technologies such as AJAX, PHP, HTML, CSS, and SQL, we were able to create a memorable experience for everyone involved.

Project Overview
C20 MillionLights is a project that showcases the capabilities of modern web technologies in hosting large-scale interactive events without the need for participants to install any additional applications. The project is managed and maintained by the dedicated team members:

Eniyan - Team Lead, Developer
Rajkumar - Developer
Features
Our project comes with a range of innovative features:

Real-Time Dynamic Page: Participants accessed a real-time dynamic webpage through their mobile devices.
Admin Control: As administrators, we had full control over the dynamic page, allowing us to change the display color of participants' mobile screens in real-time.
Mass Participation: Over 1500 participants joined the event, each holding their phones, creating a stunning visual display.
Logo Spread: The website's design incorporated the event's logo, which was distributed across participants' devices to create a unified and impactful visual effect.
No App Installation: Participants didn't need to install any additional applications. They simply accessed the website through their browser.
Technologies Used
Our project leveraged a variety of technologies to achieve its goals:

AJAX: Used for asynchronous communication between the participants' devices and our server.
PHP: Server-side scripting language to handle dynamic content generation and real-time interactions.
HTML & CSS: The building blocks of our website's structure and design.
SQL Database: Used to store and manage participant data and interaction history.
How It Works
Participants gathered in the evening, each holding their phones.
We distributed the website link to participants, instructing them to open it on their browsers.
The website displayed the event logo, which was spread across participants' devices.
Through the admin control page, we manipulated the color of participants' screens in real-time, creating a mesmerizing visual effect.
Acknowledgments
We would like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to the event organizers and faculty members who granted us the opportunity to showcase our skills and creativity in this event. It was a fantastic experience that allowed us to combine our passion for web development with the excitement of large-scale event hosting.
